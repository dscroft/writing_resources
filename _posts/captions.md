# Figure and table captions

*This section is assuming you are using Word but other word processors have equivalent functionality.*

All figures and tables in a piece of formal academic writing should have labels and captions.

This allows you to refer to specific figures and tables in your text.

E.g.

It is important that the numbers on your figures are correct. 
What you absolutely should not do is to manually number your figures and tables. 

This is a bad idea.

- If you add, remove or move any of your figures or tables to have to renumber all of them.
- If you add, remove or move any of your figures or tables to have to update all your references to them.

What you *should* be doing is using Word's built in functionality to automatically number your figures and tables and to automatically keep track of the numbers in your text.
