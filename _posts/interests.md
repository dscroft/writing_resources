## Research interests

My main interest at present is robotics and autonomous vehicles, with a particular enthusism for projects related to the Formula Student AI competition and
autonomous vehicles in general. However my PhD was in searching poorly structured (human readable) datasets using computational intelligence techniques.

Whilst I am open to supervising students with interesting project ideas in other
areas, you are really going to want to think about the answers to these questions
before you pitch your idea.

I am interested in supervising students that want to do a good dissertation
project, if you just want a bare pass then I may not be the right supervisor
for you as I will be on your back pushing you to do extra work to get the best
possible grade.
