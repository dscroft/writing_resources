# Proofreading

Making sure to proof read your documents before you submit.

The difficulty is that proofreading your own work is less effective than having another person do it as you already know what you meant to write and so can easily skip over any difficult sections.

Agreeing to swap documents with another student and each proofread the other's work can be a good way to get your work proof read for free. But be careful if you are swapping with students on the same modules as yourself. **Something something collusion.**

# Tools

Although any modern word processor will offer some degree of spelling and grammar checking, the built in options are rarely the best option in terms of quality.

[Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) is a software proof reading tool which generally performs very well. 
Grammarly has paid and free options. 

The paid service operates on a subscription model and it is possible to pay for a single month if you remember to unsubscribe.
The free version has limited functionality but will still generally outperform the built-in spelling and grammar checker in Word etc.
