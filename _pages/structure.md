The exact structure of your dissertation will depend on the nature of your project.
However, most will following a structure similar to the one listed below even if it doesn't use these exact sections.
For example, combing the Methodology and Testing or the Testing and Analysis into single chapters may well be a better fit for your specific project. 
You should do whatever is the best approach for you, but if your dissertation is missing one of these sections entirely then that is a warning sign.

If you are doing a report then you may well be skipping whole sections.

Also, do not feel that you need to write your dissertation in this order. In my experience the Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion are the last things that I finish writing as they depend so heavily on the how the project went, the issues that were encountered and the results that were achieved.
