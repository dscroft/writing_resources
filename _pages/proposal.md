# Proposal

Every year I get approached by students asking if I will supervise but when I
ask what their project idea is, it often turns out that they don't have one yet.
Just that they want to "Do something with neural networks" or "Develop some
sort of app" which is less of an idea and more of a notion.

These are the questions that I would want a student to be able to answer when
asking me to supervise. Now I freely admit that I don't actually expect students
to be able to answer all of these straight off. But you should at least have
thought about them, as part of your dissertation project we would be exploring
and developing these areas further.

You need to have these answered by the time you submit your detailed project
proposal and this information should be in that document. Alternatively, if your
project module does not have a proposal submission you need to have these
answered before you start working on the main body of your project.


# Questions

## What are you doing?

What is it that you are trying to achieve? Short version.


## What are you actually going to produce?

At the end of your dissertation there needs to be a thing. Something that exists
that did not exist when you started, it could be:

- A piece of software.
- A device.
- An algorithm/process.
- A dataset.
- A new fact.
- A series of recommendations.
- Or something else.

What is it that you are going to have actually produced at the end of the project?

It is important to mention that you generally do not need to produce a final
commercial product, for many projects a proof of concept is all that is required.
Your output may barely be functional and held together with duct tape, but you
have demonstrated that the idea is possible if you were to take it further in the
future.


## How is your thing different?

Ok so you are going to produce a thing. 
It's unlikely that you're creating an entirely new category of thing, more than likely it's an improvement or a variation on an existing thing. 
Now, it does not need to be big, but you can't just do the same thing that has been done 100 times before because that's boring and also pointless.

Short version, if there is a tutorial online telling you how to do it, then it's too
generic for a dissertation project. This is not to say that you can't use online
tutorials, but that can't be the entirety of your project.

So how is your thing different from all the similar things that have been created
before?

- I want to train a neural network - It's been done.
- I want to train a neural network to detect objects in images - It's been done.
- I want to train a neural network to identify objects in images for self-driving cars - It's been done.
- I want to train a neural network to identify traffic cones for the Warwick Univeristy self-driving race car - I'm getting interested, it's been done but only a couple of times.
- I want to train a neural network to identify traffic cones for the Warwick Univeristy self-driving race car that is better than the previous networks - Oooh, I like this idea.
  
## Why should I care?

Why should I, or anyone else care if you manage to create this thing? Who is
the audience for this and why does it matter?

- I want to develop a new app - There are thousands of new apps every day, I don't care.
- I want to develop a new Flappy Birds app - I don't care about Flappy Birds v2.
- I want to develop a new Flappy Birds app that helps to teach people to identify real birds - I'm slightly more interested, but why do we care if people can identify birds?
- I want to develop a new Flappy Birds app that helps to teach people to identify real birds so they can help with conservation - Oooh, I'm interested, conservation is important.
  

## How are you going to know if your thing is any good?
You can't just produce a thing, you need to produce a good thing. 
But good is such a vague term, computing almost always involves compromises somewhere.
You can make something faster but it needs more power. You can make something
more energy efficient but it's slower. You can make something more user friendly,
but it has fewer features.

So what exactly are you trying to improve?

If it's a website, is it a good website?

- Is it faster/smaller/more user-friendly/better looking/more features?


If it's a piece of software, is it a good piece of software?

- Does it work faster/less memory/more userfriendly than existing software?
- Is it the first piece of software to solve a given problem? Can we solve it faster/better than we could before because we have this software?


If it's a dataset, is it a good dataset?

- Is it bigger, more representative than existing ones?
- When machine learning models are trained on it do those models perform better?


## How are you going to test that?

You can't just say "I made a thing and it's good". This is a research project, if
we knew for certain that it was going to work then it isn't research. So either
there is uncertainty about whether your thing actually does what it's supposed
to and importantly whether it's any good at it or you always knew it was going
to work and be good and it wasn't worth doing a research project on it in the
first place.

Now if there is already a similar pre-existing thing then proving your thing is
good is easy, you can just compare it to the pre-existing thing and see if yours is
better.

If there is no pre-existing thing, the then easiest solution is to compare your
thing to the alternative. E.g. if you have managed to automate something that
used to be done manually then you compare your thing to doing it manually.

Importantly it doesn't matter if your thing is actually any good. As long as your
idea wasn't ridiculous ("I'm going to make the code faster by converting it from
C to Python" or "I'm going to make the website more user friendly by making
the text and the background the same colour" etc) then a negative result is still
valuable information. A good idea that doesn't work is not going to lose you
any marks.


## Right but how exactly are you going to test it?

If your *thing* is supposed to be faster, time it.

If your *thing* is supposed to be better at solving a problem, compare the new
solutions to the old solutions. Is it more accurate, precise or has better recall?

If your *thing* is supposed to be more user friendly, show it to a bunch of people
and ask which one they prefer. This is qualitative data and starts to get tricker
than just comparing quantitative data (e.g. times) but can be done without too
much fuss.

If your *thing* is a set of recommendations, you could show them to subject
experts and get their feedback. This is qualitative data and much trickier to
analyse, I frankly don't recommend you do a project like this. A project like
this definitely could be good, but I have yet to mark a good one (Computing
and related subjects).

- I am going to run my software - Well duh! But you're not actually saying anything.
- I am going to test my software - How? just saying I'm gunna test it doesn't mean anything.
- I am going to test my software to see if it is better - Better that what? Sliced bread? Being punched in the face? Star Wars episode I?
- I am going to test my software to see if it is better than the old software - Better doesn't mean anything on its own, better how?
- I am going to test my software to see if it more efficient than the old software - Efficient can mean many things, time, memory, storage space, user interactions, what?
- I am going to test my software to see if it is faster than the old software - Ok, a good clear target, but how exactly are you going to know if it is faster?
- I am going to test my software to see if it is faster than the old software by running both pieces of software through
multiple tests and timing how long each one takes to complete. Then I can compare the times and see which one is lower on average. - Excellent, I like this plan.
