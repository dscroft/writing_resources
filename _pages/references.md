# Finding sources

Crowdsourced websites such as Wikipedia are not acceptable sources for academic work as they can be edited by anyone.
You can use Wikipedia as a starting point for your research but look at the sources that Wikipedia is citing to support its statement and read those.

## Bibliography

Different types of sources are formatted in different ways.

When you are citing a source, you must cite it according to the format that it was released in.
Don't cite everything as a website just because you did all your research online.

- If you are reading a book that has been digitised, you cite it as a book, not as a website.
- If you are reading a journal article on a website, you cite it as a journal article, not as a website.
- If you are watching a youtube video of a lecture, you cite it as a lecture, not as a website.
- If you are reading a website, then you cite it as a website.
