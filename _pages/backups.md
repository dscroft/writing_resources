It is vital that your dissertation is backed up.

Having a pendrive that you occasionally remember to copy things onto and then store in the same bag your laptop isn't good enough.

I strongly recommend that you use a system that automatically backs up all your work, ideally online. In an age of cloud providers and free accounts there really is no excuse.

My rule is if it would be lost in a direct meteor strike then it's not backed up. 
A minimum of two copies, at least one of them offsite.

The university does not accepted data loss as a valid mitigating circumstance and has not for several years.
If you accidentally delete the copy of your dissertation the day before the deadline, sucks to be you.


## Online backups

You get access to Onedrive for free with your university account which is the official recommendation.

There are multiple alternative providers (e.g. pCloud) with free account options that are available if an alternative is needed.


## Version control

If your project involves any form of software development your code should also be version controlled. 

You will have access to the university github instance at https://github.coventry.ac.uk.
This provides you with another online backup location as well as supporting evidence in the event of an academic conduct investigation.
