There is a good chance that you are planning on using Microsoft Word or similar software to write you reports.

No issues there but it is important that you make use of the functionality of your word processing software as much as possible. 
It is one thing to have formatting issues or incorrect page counts when writing a document by hand, it is quite another to have them when writing in word processing software that can handle all of that for you automatically.

Below is a list of functionality that exists in Word that I expect you to make use of when submitting work. 
If you are not using MS Word then there almost certainly equivalent functionality but you will need to find appropriate instructions yourself.

## Caption numbering

## Automatic table of contents

## Automatic Bibliography

## Style management

## Spelling and grammar checks

MS Word comes with a built in spelling and grammar checker.

For more advice see []().

## Spreadsheet importing

## Charts and figures

Do not take screenshots of charts and diagrams and then include these. 
Most software will allow you to save your charts etc as images directly, you can then include these files in your report.

The reason we do this is to avoid including low resolution images in our document.

If you are creating charts in MS Excel then you can simply copy the chart from your spreadsheet and paste it into MS Word.
