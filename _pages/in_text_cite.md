# In text citations

In text citations are the bits of text in brackets that appear in the text that you write to let the reader know where they can find the supporting evidence for the point that you are making or what the original source of the information that you are present is.

Importantly the in text citation (everything in brackets), is not a grammatical object and does not form part of the sentence. 
Your sentences have to make sense and be grammatically correct if everything in brackets is removed.

For example:

If you were to write "(Smith et al., 2022) and team has a prominent paper.” that is incorrect. 

Firstly, nothing in brackets is part of the sentence. 

- The sentence as written is "and team has a prominent paper.", which has multiple issues.
  - First letter is not capitalised.
  - Doesn't make sense.
  - Sentence should have been “Smith et al. (2022) and team has a prominent paper.”.
  - Your reference management software will let you insert citations in this manner.
  
Secondly, the "et al.".

- This is already making you aware that there were others involved so the “and team” section is redundant.
  - Sentence should have been "(Smith et al., 2022) has a prominent paper."

Thirdly, "has" is incorrect.

- When referening to multiple people the correct verb form is "have".
  - Sentence should have been "(Smith et al., 2022) and team have a prominent paper.”

With all the changes made the sentence should have been written:

"Smith et al. (2022) have a prominent paper.”
