## Writing by hand

Dont.

I am not saying that it cannot be done correctly, I am just saying that I have yet to see a single student at any level of study (undergraduate, masters, or PhD) correctly manage and format all of their citations when doing it by hand.

Writing your citations and bibliography by hand is a stupid decision that will waste lots of your time, will annoy me when I mark your work and will loose you marks.


# Word's built in functionality

*This section is assuming you are using Word but other word processors have equivilent functionality.*

Word have a built-in reference management tool accessible under the "References" tab in the ribbon bar.

The built-in functionality is sufficient but it lacks of features that 3rd party tools come with.

## Other tools

There are a wide range of other reference management tools.

Coventry provides a refworks account for you during your study.
